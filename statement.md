Project Statement: Travel Agency Management System (TAMS)

1. The Challenge (The Problem)

The core problem TAMS addresses is the inefficiency and high risk of error associated with managing travel bookings manually (e.g., using spreadsheets or paper). This manual process leads to:

Data Loss: Information is easily lost because the current records are not persistent.

Overbooking: Agents can accidentally sell more seats than are available due to slow updates.

Slow Customer Service: Simple tasks like finding a flight or canceling a booking take too long.

2. The Solution (The Goal)

The goal of the TAMS project is to create a centralized, automated system that acts as the single source of truth for all agency operations.

The system will:

Automate Validation: Instantly check and manage flight inventory and customer data.

Ensure Data Integrity: Guarantee that bookings and cancellations are performed correctly every time.

Provide a Foundation: Establish a robust architectural core that can be scaled up easily.

3. Project Status and Future Direction

TAMS is currently a functional Python prototype with a Command Line Interface (CLI). This prototype successfully proves the core business logic.

The future roadmap is focused on turning this prototype into a real-world, dependable application by prioritizing:

Reliability: Migrating all data from temporary memory to a persistent database.

Scalability: Introducing multi-user access and security features (authentication) to handle multiple agents working at once.

Usability: Developing a modern, responsive Graphical User Interface (GUI) to replace the current CLI.
